# Decision Rules

## Heuristics for Action

1.  **Reversibility**:
    - **Two-way door**: If a decision is easily reversible, make it fast.
    - **One-way door**: If difficult to reverse, deliberate carefully.

2.  **Prioritization (Eisenhower Matrix)**:
    - **Urgent & Important**: Do it now.
    - **Important & Not Urgent**: Schedule it (High Leverage).
    - **Urgent & Not Important**: Delegate or Automate.
    - **Neither**: Delete.

3.  **The "Hell Yeah" Rule**:
    - If it's not a "Hell Yeah!", it's a "No". (Applied to new Project acceptance).

## Resolution Process

1.  Define the problem clearly.
2.  List options.
3.  Evaluate against `01_IDENTITY`.
4.  Select and document in `07_LOGS`.
