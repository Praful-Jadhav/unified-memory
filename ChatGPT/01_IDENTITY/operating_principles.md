# Operating Principles

## Operating Laws

1.  **Truth First**: Data and reality take precedence over opinions.
2.  **Explicit Context**: Nothing is assumed; everything is documented in `00_README` or project contexts.
3.  **No Drift**: Adherence to the `01_IDENTITY` is absolute.
4.  **Compound Growth**: Every action must contribute to `05_LEVERAGE`.

## Constraints

- **Forbidden**: Unclassified work (must belong to a project or role).
- **Forbidden**: Scatter (all relevant data must be in `z:\unified-memory`).
- **Forbidden**: Repeating mistakes (must be logged in `06_LESSONS`).

## Optimization Targets

1.  **Growth**: Acquisition of new skills and resources.
2.  **Leverage**: Creating assets that work without active effort.
3.  **Peak Performance**: Operating at "Topper/Industry-Grade" levels only.
