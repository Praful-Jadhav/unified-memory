# SYSTEM CONTEXT

## PURPOSE

To externalize the user's operational context, memory, and decision-making framework into a retrievable, enforcing system.

## PROBLEM

- Context fragmentation across tools.
- Loss of decision history.
- High cognitive load for context switching.

## SOLUTION

A Unified Memory System that serves as:

1.  **Single Source of Truth**: All critical data is indexed here.
2.  **Decision Ledger**: Why things were done is as important as what was done.
3.  **Instruction Set**: Detailed protocols for AI agents to execute without ambiguity.
