# SYSTEM SCOPE

## IN BOUNDS

- **Core Documentation**: Standards, Roles, Identity, Logs.
- **Active Projects**: Tracking of high-level goals and milestones.
- **Decision Records**: Logging critical pivots and approvals.
- **Operational Protocols**: Instructions for AI and Human execution.

## OUT OF BOUNDS

- **Raw Data Storage**: Large binaries or datasets (referenced, not stored).
- **Ephemeral Chat Logs**: Conversations without structural value.
- **Personal Journaling**: Emotional processing (unless relevant to performance).
- **Code Repositories**: Code stays in git; only architecture/intent is documented here.
