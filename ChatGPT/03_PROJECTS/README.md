# PROJECTS (THE HEART)

Each project has its own folder:

```
project-name/
├── context.md        ← problem, why it exists
├── scope.md          ← what is included / excluded
├── execution.md      ← how to do it
├── leverage.md       ← what to extract
└── status.md         ← active / paused / done
```

This is how memory survives time.
